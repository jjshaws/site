title: "Surma River Workers"
---
On a trip to Sylhet in Bangladesh, I spent an afternoon touring the Surma river in a [Sampan-style boat](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Sampan). Along the river, there were teams of labourers using buckets and shovels to transfer sand from the riverbed into boats, then down the riverbank into piles. According to our driver, these labourers are paid about 80 Taka (~1 CAD) per cubic foot of sand delivered to the riverbank.
